version 1.4.2 2014-06-24

       Update
       New function qqgev() for producing Q-Q plots for the GEV distribution.
       (Christoph Frei)

version 1.4.1 2014-04-15

       Update
       Output from fitGEV() and fitGPD() now includes the p-value of
       the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. Note that this is actually a misuse
       of the test, which assumes that the data have not been used for
       parameter estimation. The test results may nevertheless be useful
       for identifying data quality problems in automated application of
       GEV/GPD.

version 1.4.0 2014-02-04

       Update
       Merged changes from version 1.3.8-1 till 1.3.8-3 (from Sophie)
       with changes made independently (by Chrigel).
       (Christoph Frei)

version 1.3.8-3 2013-12-10
       plot.conf.pot.R
       plot.conf.xval.R  replaced as.real by as.double as this function
	                 does not exist in R 3.0 any more
       (Sophie Fukutome)

version 1.3.8-2 2012-07-04
       fitGPD.mlik:	 tim=len/(lamda*theta) for consistency
       (Sophie Fukutome)
       
version 1.3.8-1 2011-06-06
       plot.thresh.diag: use unique to avoid plotting problems due to 
			 ties in threshold. 
       fitGPD.mlik: 	 correct expression of foft so that it takes 
			 clustering into account by taking lamda*t*theta 
			 as a return period, rather than lamda*t.
			 theta is the extremal index, i.e. the 
			 reciprocal mean cluster size. 
			 This is important for the estimation of 
			 return levels (s. Coles, p.103), because one 
			 should be counting clusters, rather than exceedances.
			 (fus, 6.6.2011) 
       same for fitGPD.lmom, fitEXPON.mlik, fitEXPON.lmom
       (Sophie Fukutome)

version 1.3.7 2013-06-10

       Minor Update
       Changed numeric increment for the calculation of likelihood
       profile confidence intervals for return values. 
       Functions changed: conf.bounds.pot.lprof(), conf.bounds.xval.lprof()
       Argument frac.incr to the calls of lik.prof() was changed from 
       1/10 to 1/50 when confidence intervals were calculated for return
       values and shapes larger than 0.25 (k < -0.25). 
       This avoids failures of the likelihood profile calculation
       occurring in cases with large (positive) shape (negative k) at large
       return periods. The case of hourly precipitation in Zurich dealt with
       in the lecture was the motivation to improve this. 
       In cases when this reduction of the increment is effective the
       likelihood profile calculations last considerably longer.
